## Purpose
Generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick acces to their emails and git hub profiles.

## Website Functionality/Class Criteria Met
* When User starts the application,  the user is prompted to select a team Manager, Engineer, Intern.  
* When the user selects an employee,  they are then prompted with a series of questions about that employee. 
* Manager Prompt requests (Managers Name, employee ID, email address, and office number)
* Engineer Prompt requests (Engineer Name, employee ID, email address, Github username)
* Intern Prompt requests (Intern Name, employee ID, email address, school)
* After all pompts are selected for an employee,  the user is taken back to the list of employees.  The user can select the employee they would like to add and then answer a series of prompts.  
* If user selects No Additional Employees then team array and message stating Team created successfully is console logged.  Promptes end and team.html is generated under dist folder.
